Random notes and stuff, likely to become feedback to Andrew:

- static files is weird. how should it work in prod? WhiteNoise-ish would be
  ideal; integrate with Daphe?
- channel backend - parse from URL?
- "routing" in websockets is weird - there's a path, but realy only a single
  consumer. some sort of url-ish routing perhaps?

        websocket.connect -> path dispatch -> websocket.connect.{path} channel

- debugging errors in websocket consumers SUCKS
